# get-mcp-keys Enhancement Plan

## 1. Code Improvements

- [ ] Add configuration options:
  - [ ] Support alternative `.mcprc` file path via environment variable (e.g., `MCP_RC_PATH`)
  - [ ] Add a debug/verbose mode flag (`--verbose` or `-v`)
  - [ ] Create a quiet mode to suppress all non-error output (`--quiet` or `-q`)

- [ ] Enhance error handling:
  - [ ] Add specific handling for file permission issues
  - [ ] Implement validation for parsed environment variables
  - [ ] Provide more descriptive error messages with potential solutions

- [ ] Improve environment variable parsing:
  - [ ] Consider using a dedicated `.env` parser library (dotenv)
  - [ ] Add support for multiline values
  - [ ] Handle escaped characters and quoted values properly

- [ ] Refactor for maintainability:
  - [ ] Split functionality into separate modules/functions
  - [ ] Add JSDoc comments for better code documentation
  - [ ] Implement logging with configurable levels

## 2. Testing

- [ ] Implement unit tests:
  - [ ] Test `.mcprc` file parsing with various formats
  - [ ] Test environment variable combination
  - [ ] Test command execution with mocked child processes

- [ ] Add integration tests:
  - [ ] Test with actual environment files
  - [ ] Test command execution with real commands

- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting

## 3. Documentation

- [ ] Enhance README:
  - [ ] Add clear installation instructions
  - [ ] Provide more comprehensive usage examples
  - [ ] Document all command-line options
  - [ ] Include a troubleshooting section

- [ ] Add inline code documentation:
  - [ ] Complete JSDoc comments for all functions
  - [ ] Add examples in comments

- [ ] Create security best practices guide:
  - [ ] Recommendations for `.mcprc` file permissions
  - [ ] Guidelines for managing sensitive API keys

## 4. Security Enhancements

- [ ] Implement file permission checks for `.mcprc`
- [ ] Add option for encryption of `.mcprc` file
- [ ] Improve redaction of sensitive information in logs
- [ ] Add ability to validate API keys before executing commands

## 5. Package Distribution

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline:
  - [ ] Automated testing
  - [ ] Automated npm publishing
  - [ ] Version bumping

- [ ] Add package distribution files:
  - [ ] Update `"files"` field in package.json
  - [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md
  - [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines

## 6. Advanced Features

- [ ] Support alternative configuration formats:
  - [ ] JSON format support for `.mcprc`
  - [ ] YAML format support for `.mcprc`

- [ ] Add key management features:
  - [ ] CLI command to safely add/update keys
  - [ ] Command to list available keys (redacted)
  - [ ] Per-project configuration overrides

- [ ] Implement credential rotation support:
  - [ ] Support for multiple credentials per service
  - [ ] Built-in expiration warnings for API keys
